unix:


to compile ppm type the following in the ppm-directory:

make

to install the binaries into /usr/local/bin/ type:

make install


windows:

to compile ppm add "-DWIN32" (defines WIN32) to the makefile and type

make

or if you have visual studio then you can open the project/
workspace files for ppm that come with the archive and use vs to
do the dirty work for you.


if compiling/linking fails, try to give (if you are using bash)
 
export LD=gcc
export CC=gcc
 
and try again. otherwise you'll have to edit the makefile.
